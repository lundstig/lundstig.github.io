        <h2>What is this?</h2>
		<p>Chatter is a simple chat site where you're connected with another random user.<br>
            The conversations are logged, mostly so I have the possibility of looking at neat graphs and statistics in the future. Don't send private information you don't want me to know about, even though I'm not sure why you'd send that to a stranger in the first place.</p>
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>The client transmits all of your actions to the server with the help of a some javascript and websockets.<br>
            The server is implemented using <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">node.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/theturtle32/WebSocket-Node" target="_blank">WebSocket-Node</a>.
        <h2>It doesn't work!</h2>
        <p>If it's not working, or you have any comments, suggestions or bug reports, please send me an email at <a href="mailto:chatter@lundstig.com" target="_blank">chatter@lundstig.com</a>.</p>
